This is a port of the statlib S-package multiv to R. The only changes
that were made is that all single precision in the fortran code (and
corresponding S code) has been changed to double precision. The man
pages have been converted automatically by Sd2Rd and the examples
have been changed to work with data contained in R.

This port has not been tested too much (besides trying some of the
examples).
